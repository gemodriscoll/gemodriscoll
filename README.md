### Hey there!👋

I'm **Gem**, a UX designer and data storyteller based in Australia.

Currently: Master of Computer Science @ QUT | Previously: Psychology grad who switched from studying people to designing for them.

I like to build interfaces that make sense and find stories hidden in data.

My main tech stack is Python, C#, Tableau, and PowerBI. My favourite tools are Figma, VS Code, Procreate on my iPad, and Notion (way too much Notion).
